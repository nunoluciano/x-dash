We aim to provide the patterns and tools required for developers to create high quality code which is suitable for use across both products.</p>\n<p>We want to do this to provide a consistent experience for our users who move between the two and act as an aid the technical evolution of both products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-this-a-challenge\"><a href=\"#why-is-this-a-challenge\" aria-label=\"why is this a challenge permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why is this a challenge?</h2>\n<p>Making components for both The App and FT.com is a technical challenge because the two products have different tech stacks, different architectures, and a different history. This means we must find a new middleground without introducing compromises or new technologies which might prevent teams from adopting it.</p>\n<p>This project is also a tricky cultural challenge because the two products have different life-cycles — the website ships many times a day, whereas an app may remain on a user's phone for several months — and not all existing components may have been originally conceived with both products in mind meaning we are unable to \"lift and shift\" them.</p>\n<p>And finally, both are enormous projects. Pivoting is not easy and takes a lot of effort. As a <a href=\"http://matt.chadburn.co.uk/notes/teams-as-services.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">free market</a> we can only convince teams to adopt x-dash by providing a truly better alternative to their current tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-different-about-x-dash\"><a href=\"#what-is-different-about-x-dash\" aria-label=\"what is different about x dash permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is different about x-dash?</h2>\n<p>With x-dash we have introduced a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">monorepo</a> project structure, new <a href=\"https://github.com/Financial-Times/x-dash/blob/master/contribution.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">contribution guidelines</a>, and a new <a href=\"../components/release-guidelines.md\">release process</a>.

The aim of x-dash is to ensure all components are compatible with a variety of runtimes for both the server and the client-side, including <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React</a>.</p>\n<p>By ensuring compatibility with React it is possible to take advantage of the fantastic tooling made available by that community, including <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Storybook</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Enzyme</a>. In addition, adopting these tools means that we are able to position our technology programmes more closely to the prevailing sentiment of the development community and therefore potential employees.</p>","headings":[{"value":"What is x-dash?","depth":1},{"value":"What are goals of this project?","depth":2},{"value":"Why is this a challenge?","depth":2},{"value":"What is different about x-dash?","depth":2},{"value":"Does x-dash mean we can use React?","depth":2}]},"menu":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Get started","items":[{"title":"What is x-dash?","link":"/docs/get-started/what-is-x-dash"},{"title":"Installation","link":"/docs/get-started/installation"},{"title":"Working with x-dash","link":"/docs/get-started/working-with-x-dash"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Components in-depth","items":[{"title":"Overview","link":"/docs/components/overview"},{"title":"Creating components","link":"/docs/components/creation"},{"title":"JavaScript","link":"/docs/components/javascript"},{"title":"Styling","link":"/docs/components/styling"},{"title":"Stories","link":"/docs/components/stories"},{"title":"Interactions","link":"/docs/components/interactions"},{"title":"Testing","link":"/docs/components/testing"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Integrating x-dash","items":[{"title":"Using components","link":"/docs/integration/using-components"},{"title":"Local development","link":"/docs/integration/local-development"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Guides","items":[{"title":"Migrating to x-teaser","link":"/docs/guides/migrating-to-x-teaser"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"type":"documentation-page","source":"docs","title":"What is x-dash?"}}
